## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions:  ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow
3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users):sudo useradd joe, sudo useradd amy, sudo useradd sam, sudo useradd sara, sudo useradd admin

2. Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.

    - Command to edit `pwquality.conf` file: sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    - Updates to configuration file: # Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if
# credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_cracklib manual.)
# Cannot be set to lower value than 6.
# minlen = 16

3. Force passwords to expire every 90 days.

    - Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users): sudo chage -M 90 admin, sudo chage -M 90 sara, sudo chage -M 90 amy, sudo chage -M 90 joe, sudo chage -M 90 sam


4. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group:sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo groupadd engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): sudo usermod -aG engineers sara,sudo usermod -aG engineers joe, sudo usermod -aG engineers amy, sudo usermod -aG engineers sam

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir /home/engineers 

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chgrp -R engineers /home/engineers |

5. Add the SGID bit and the sticky bit to allow collaboration between engineers in this directory. 

    - Command to set SGID and sticky bit to shared folder:  sudo chmod -R 700 /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man lynis

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.

### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit: sudo apt install chkrootkit

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man chrootkit

3. Command to run expert mode: sudo chkrootkit -x

4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
